        "\n",
        "Expectation Maximization (EM) is an algorithm designed for finding the mixes of a certain dataset. A mixed dataset means that data points can cmoe from different distributions. For EM to work, we need to know two things about the data:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. How many distributions are associated with the dat\n",
        "2. What those distributions are\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, say we have a dataset call $H$ that is mixed with a Normal, Exponential, and Uniform distribution. We would need to know that there are 3 distributions and that those distributions are a Normal, Exponential, and a Uniform.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are multiple steps to this algorithm work, in which I will explain each one:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Initialization, we set each mixture component weight, called $\\pi_j$ for distribution $j$ to a value $\\in [0,1]$ such that all the mixture components added together $= 1$ (so basically a probability distribution of distributions). We also set initial parameters for all the distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. We repeat the following steps until we reach convergence or we have reached the number of iterations desired\n",
        "\n",
        "3. The E-step: We use what we know about the data points, the weights of the distributions, and the pdf's associated with each distributions to give us probabililies that a data point came from a particular distribution, or the number of samples from a particular distribution run\n",
        "\n",
        "4. The M-step: We update the mixing weights by averaging the probabilities that a data point come from a particular distribution over all data points for each component.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. We check for convergence or if we reached number of iterations.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two strategies in doing Expectation Maximization, and my goal is to analyze each strategy and to look at the pros and cons of each.\n",
        "\n",
        "I will start by explaining the first method which if by computing responsibilities (Normal Method of EM). Responsibilities are the probabililies that a data point came from a particular distribution. I didn't want to say this at the start because the other strategy doesn't use responsibilities, so I thought it would confuse some.\n",
        "\n",
        "The difference between the strategies is how they change in the E-step and M-step. For the normal method, once we have initialized everything, our E-step goes as follows:\n",
        "Compute:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\gamma_{ij} = P(z_i = j \\mid x_i, \\theta) = \\frac{\\pi_j \\cdot f_j(x_i)}{\\sum_k \\pi_k \\cdot f_k(x_i)}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        " for all combinations or a data point and distribution\n",
        "\n",
        "Where $\\gamma_{ij}$ is the responsibility or probability that data point $x_i$ came from the distribution $j$.\n",
        "\n",
        "We then do the M-step for Normal EM, which is:\n",
        "\n",
        "Update the mixture weights by taking the average over all responsibilities associated with mixture $j$, or:\n",
        "\n",

        "\\pi_j = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\gamma_{ij} \\quad\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "For an intuitional sense, imagine that we acquire a responsibility super high associated with a data point and distribution (which likely means that the pdf value at the data point was high with respect to the others). This means that the probability the x_i is associated with that distribution is high. Since this is true, it would increase our mixture amount because we have a data point that is extremely \"connected\" to that certain distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "The next method is the point in which this project came to fruition in the first place.\n",

        "The Expection Maximization Monte Carlo Method\n",
        "\n",
        "This is supposed to approximate the responsibility, or normal EM. The reason why someone may do such a method is because the calculations for the responsibilities may be hard to compute.\n",
        "\n",
        "You approximate the responsibilites by sampling in Monte Carlo style: for all the data points, make a Monte Carlo Markov Chain over for however many iterations, and basing our decision to go to a different node, or more specifically, making an educated guess on what distribution this data point comes from by using the acceptance ratio:\n",

        "What this becomes are samples of each data point, and for our M-step we look at all the different samples, and compute:\n",

        "Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "For my methods in analyzing these two methods, I will first start by implementing them into python and give a couple miniature examples of a mixed dataset and see how these methods favor. I will produce my own dataset to which I know all the true information of: The mixing weights, parameters, distributions, etc. and compare that as well to the results that both methods got.\n",
        "\n",
        "Later on, we will create a random mixing distribution sampler where it creates mixes of distribution sizing from 2 to 8 mixes. The parameters will all be random in a certain predetermined interval for each.\n",

Whats important here is the inclusion of the min_weight, which tells us that no matter what no mixed weight will be below 0.05. This can obviously cause problems for higher mixes, but if we didn't have some minimum value here we could possibly get a mixing weight of 0. This would in turn totally close off the distribution being a possibility for the next sample. This is normalized then after.\n"
