Expectation Maximization: Responsibility Method and MCMC Method

This project analyzes two different ways of doing Expectation Maximization (EM) and shows the pros and cons of each. The LaTeX file gives a brief overview of what EM is and the methods we'll be using, and then goes into the coding implementation of each method, analyzes the different methods, and provides a brief summary of the results we got.

Note: This is a work in progress project - please excuse minor mistakes, typos, etc. in the code and/or writeup.
